# Introduction
This dataset, titled Student Performance, provides a comprehensive view of student achievement across two core subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese. It includes a diverse range of features, such as demographic, social, and school-related variables, with grades from different assessment periods. By analyzing this dataset, We aim to uncover patterns and relationships that contribute to academic success, which could inform data-driven interventions in education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators and policymakers to identify areas for support, which will ultimately enhancing student achievement. Key questions include: How do parental education levels affect student outcomes? What impact do extracurricular activities and study habits have on performance? Additionally, the dataset allows for predictive modeling, offering valuable insights into final grade predictions based on prior performance and other influencing factors. This analysais not only deepens our understanding of real-world applications of data science in education but also highlights the potential of data-driven strategies to improve learning outcomes.
