# Conclusion
This analysis explores the factors that influence academic performance, such as family background, health, attendance, and individual behaviors. For example, students with parents who have higher education levels or who foster supportive family relationships tend to perform better academically. Aspirations for higher education also play a significant role in boosting grades. On the other hand, absenteeism and behaviors like alcohol consumption often lead to academic challenges, particularly for students who have struggled in the past.One limitation of this study is that it doesn’t fully account for external factors like socioeconomic status or school policies, which can significantly shape a student’s educational experience. To address this, future research could take a longer-term view, using longitudinal studies or incorporating additional variables to gain a deeper understanding of these influences.A key takeaway is the importance of blending data analysis with real-world context. By doing so, we can uncover actionable insights that support interventions for students at risk of falling behind, ultimately helping them achieve their potential.
