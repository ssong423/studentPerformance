# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset on student performance in Mathematics and Portuguese, focusing on demographic, social, and school-related variables. The dataset includes grades from three stages of assessment (G1, G2, G3) and various contextual factors that influence academic outcomes. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and relationships that can inform data-driven interventions in education.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the dataset and research questions.
2. **Data**: Description of variables and missing values.
3. **Results**: Detailed analysis covering academic trends, family background, individual behaviors, and multivariate patterns.
    - **3.1 Overall Academic Trends**: General patterns in grade progression across assessment stages.
    - **3.2 Impact of Family Background on Final Grades**: Influence of parental education, family relationships, and guardianship on academic outcomes.
    - **3.3 Individual Factors Influencing Academic Performance**: The role of health, attendance, and behavioral habits in shaping grades.
    - **3.4 Background Variables and Categorical Analysis**: Interaction of demographic and support variables, such as family and school support.
    - **3.5 Multivariate Analysis and Comprehensive Patterns**: Using PCA and parallel coordinate plots to reveal deeper relationships among variables.
4. **Interactive Graph**: A D3.js-powered visualization for exploring the impact of family relationships on final grades.
5. **Conclusion**: Key takeaways, limitations, and directions for future research.

## Key Insights
- **Family Background**: Higher parental education levels and positive family relationships strongly correlate with improved grades.
- **Behavioral Factors**: Absenteeism and negative behaviors, such as alcohol consumption, are critical predictors of academic struggles, especially for students with prior failures.
- **Support Systems**: Aspirations for higher education, family support, and school support play significant roles in boosting academic performance.
- **Multivariate Patterns**: Contextual and behavioral variables interact in complex ways, with structured routines and supportive environments driving better outcomes.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the **Interactive Graph** section to explore the impact of family relationships on grades.
2. Review the detailed analysis in the **Results** section to understand key trends and relationships.
3. Use the **Conclusion** section as a summary of findings and recommendations.
