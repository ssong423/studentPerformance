### Edit `_quarto.yml` (RStudio)

Tip: From the file pane in RStudio, open `README.md`, which contains these instructions. You can delete steps as you complete them.

- [ ] 1. Change the all caps info in the `title:`, `author:` and `repo-url` fields in the YAML (top) section of `_quarto.yml` to your info. (Note: it's very important to maintain the indenting structure in this file precisely as is -- be careful!)

### Render the book (RStudio)

- [ ] 1. If you haven't already, click "Help" "Check for Updates" to make sure you have the latest version of RStudio (and thus have Quarto installed.)

- [ ] 2. Render the web site locally by clicking the "Build" tap on the right and then "Render Book".

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `docs/index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book on GitHub Pages.)

### Update README (GitHub or RStudio)

- [ ] 1. Delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project in its place. If you're working locally, be sure to commit and push the changes to GitHub.

### Optional

- [ ] 1. Choose a theme from [https://bootswatch.com/](https://bootswatch.com/) and replace "cosmo" in `_quarto.yml` with your prefered theme.
