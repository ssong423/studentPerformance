    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis dataset, titled Student Performance, provides a comprehensive view of student achievement across two core subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese. It includes a diverse range of features, such as demographic, social, and school-related variables, with grades from different assessment periods. By analyzing this dataset, We aim to uncover patterns and relationships that contribute to academic success, which could inform data-driven interventions in education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators and policymakers to identify areas for support, which will ultimately enhancing student achievement. Key questions include: How do parental education levels affect student outcomes? What impact do extracurricular activities and study habits have on performance? Additionally, the dataset allows for predictive modeling, offering valuable insights into final grade predictions based on prior performance and other influencing factors. This analysais not only deepens our understanding of real-world applications of data science in education but also highlights the potential of data-driven strategies to improve learning outcomes.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we use the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset was collected by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva from the University of Minho. It contains data on secondary school students from two Portuguese schools, providing attributes such as demographic, social, and academic performance information. The dataset includes two separate files for performance in Mathematics (student-mat.csv) and Portuguese language (student-por.csv). This time, we just use student-por.csv for the project.\nThe data is stored in CSV format, making it easy to process with tool R. It includes 30 attributes for each student, such as gender, age, family background, and academic grades. The datasets have dimensions of 649 rows for Portuguese language. The data is static and does not undergo updates, as it was collected for a specific research study in 2008.\nPotential issues with the data include: Imbalanced attributes, such as few students in certain categories (e.g., higher education aspirations). Missing values, although these are not explicitly documented, will require investigation. Correlation among features, such as multiple related attributes about family and study time.\nWe imported the data using the RStudio by downloading the CSV files directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository.\nLink for the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance",

    "text": "3.2 Part 2: The Impact of Family Background on Final Grades\nFamily background, including parental education levels, family relationships, and guardianship, plays a crucial role in shaping students’ academic outcomes. In this section, we explore how these factors influence students’ final grades (G3).\n\n\n3.2.1 1. Impact of Parental Education Levels\nThe two boxplots depict the impact of Mother’s Education Level (first graph) and Father’s Education Level (second graph) on students’ final grades (G3). The results reveal some similarities and differences in how parental education correlates with academic performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\ndata_Medu &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Medu = factor(Medu, labels = c(\"None\", \"Primary\", \"Middle\", \"Secondary\", \"Higher\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(data_Medu, aes(x = G3, y = Medu, fill = Medu)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.color = \"red\", outlier.shape = 16) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"None\" = \"#D3D3D3\", \"Primary\" = \"#ADD8E6\", \n                               \"Middle\" = \"#87CEFA\", \"Secondary\" = \"#4682B4\", \"Higher\" = \"#000080\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\", \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impact of Mother's Education Level on Final Grades\",\n    x = \"Final Grade (G3)\",\n    y = \"Mother's Education Level\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_Fedu &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Fedu = factor(Fedu, labels = c(\"None\", \"Primary\", \"Middle\", \"Secondary\", \"Higher\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(data_Fedu, aes(x = G3, y = Fedu, fill = Fedu)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.color = \"red\", outlier.shape = 16) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"None\" = \"#D3D3D3\", \"Primary\" = \"#ADD8E6\", \n                               \"Middle\" = \"#87CEFA\", \"Secondary\" = \"#4682B4\", \"Higher\" = \"#000080\")) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\", \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impact of Father's Education Level on Final Grades\",\n    x = \"Final Grade (G3)\",\n    y = \"Father's Education Level\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with parents who have higher education levels (“Higher”) consistently achieve better grades, as seen in their higher medians and tighter interquartile ranges (IQR), indicating both stronger and more consistent academic outcomes. This trend is evident for both mothers and fathers, with mothers’ education levels having a slightly stronger impact, particularly in the “None” and “Primary” categories.\nFor parents with “Middle” or “Secondary” education levels, median grades are relatively stable, but variability increases, reflecting a wider range of performance. In contrast, students with parents in the “None” or “Primary” categories have the lowest median grades and the greatest variability, suggesting limited academic support.\nOverall, as parental education levels increase, grades improve and become more consistent. This highlights the significant role of educated parents in fostering academic success and reducing performance disparities.\n\n\n3.2.2 2. Influence of Family Relationships\nThis ridgeline plot visualizes the distribution of students’ final grades (G3) across different levels of family relationship quality (famrel), ranging from “Very Poor” to “Very Good”. The plot highlights how family dynamics might correlate with academic performance.\n\n\nCode\ndata_famrel &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    famrel = factor(famrel, labels = c(\"Very Poor\", \"Poor\", \"Average\", \"Good\", \"Very Good\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(data_famrel, aes(x = G3, y = famrel, fill = famrel)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.8, scale = 1.5) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"D\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",  \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Final Grades by Family Relationship\",\n    x = \"Final Grade (G3)\",\n    y = \"Family Relationship\",\n    fill = \"Family Relationship\"\n  )\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily relationship quality has a clear influence on students’ academic performance. Students with “Very Good” relationships tend to cluster around higher grades, while those with “Very Poor” relationships exhibit flatter distributions, with a noticeable shift toward lower grades. As the quality of family relationships improves, grades become more concentrated at the upper end, indicating both better performance and consistency. However, students with “Average” relationships display a wider spread of grades, suggesting a mixture of influencing factors beyond family relationships alone.\n选一个\nFamily relationship quality clearly influences students’ academic performance, with stronger relationships correlating with better outcomes. Students with “Very Good” family relationships cluster around higher grades (closer to 20) and exhibit tighter distributions, indicating both better performance and greater consistency. Conversely, those with “Very Poor” or “Poor” relationships show broader distributions and lower grades (closer to 0-10), likely reflecting external challenges or instability affecting their academic success.\nStudents with “Average” or “Good” family relationships fall into a transitional zone, displaying more balanced grade distributions with peaks around the middle grades (10-15). While these groups perform better than students with poorer relationships, they do not reach the consistency or high performance seen in the “Very Good” category.\nDespite these trends, some overlap exists in the middle-grade range (10-15), indicating that family relationship quality is not the sole determinant of academic performance. Other factors likely contribute to this variability, suggesting the need for further analysis to fully understand the drivers of academic success.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 3.

Students under “mother” or “father” guardianship tend to have tightly clustered grade distributions, with peaks in the middle-to-high range, reflecting consistent support. In contrast, students under “other” guardianship show broader distributions, indicating greater variability and potentially less stable academic guidance.\nThe density plot shows a steady progression of grades from G1 to G3 across all guardian types, with G3 consistently achieving the highest density. While students with “mother” or “father” guardians maintain concentrated peaks, those with “other” guardians experience more dispersed outcomes, suggesting potential challenges in academic consistency.\nThese trends underscore the role of guardianship in shaping academic success, with parents providing a more stable and supportive environment for students’ educational progress.\n\n\n3.2.4 Part 2 Implications\nFamily background, including parental education levels, family relationships, and guardianship, significantly influences students’ academic performance. Educated parents provide a stable and supportive learning environment, leading to higher and more consistent grades. Positive family relationships further enhance academic success, while poor dynamics increase variability in outcomes. Guardianship types also reflect differing levels of influence, with parents providing more stable academic support compared to other guardians. These findings highlight the importance of a strong familial support system in fostering academic achievement.",

    "text": "3.3 Part 3: Individual Factors Influencing Academic Performance\nAcademic performance is often influenced by various individual factors, including attendance, prior academic challenges, and personal well-being. This section explores two critical aspects: the relationship between absences and grades, particularly in the context of previous failures, and the impact of students’ health status on their final grades (G3). By analyzing these factors, we aim to uncover patterns that highlight the challenges faced by students and identify opportunities for targeted interventions to support academic success.\n\n3.3.1 1. Absences vs final grades by Failures and Gender\nThis scatterplot visualizes the relationship between absences and final grades (G3) across different levels of failures (0-3), with points colored by gender (red for females, blue for males). The facets represent the number of previous failures, revealing distinct patterns in how absences and gender correlate with academic performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = absences, y = G3, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ failures, labeller = labeller(failures = c(\n    \"0\" = \"No Failures\",\n    \"1\" = \"1 Failure\",\n    \"2\" = \"2 Failures\",\n    \"3\" = \"3 Failures\",\n    \"4\" = \"4+ Failures\"\n  ))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Absences vs Final Grades by Failures and Gender\",\n    x = \"Absences\",\n    y = \"Final Grades (G3)\",\n    color = \"Gender\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents without past failures display the widest range of grades, primarily clustering between 10 and 15. Absences have a limited effect on this group, as even those with more than 10 absences achieve diverse grade outcomes. This suggests that for students with no history of academic struggles, attendance is not the primary determinant of performance.\nFor students with one prior failure, grades become more concentrated between 5 and 12, with fewer high achievers compared to those with no failures. Absences play a more significant role in this group, as students with more than 10 absences exhibit a clear decline in performance.\nWhen examining students with two prior failures, the majority of grades fall below 10, with very few achieving scores above this threshold. Absences further exacerbate this trend, with higher absences consistently associated with the lowest grade outcomes.\nFor students with three prior failures, grade distributions are the most restricted, with nearly all scores falling below 8. Absences amplify this already limited performance, as students with a history of repeated failures struggle to overcome the combined effects of absenteeism and prior academic challenges.\n\n3.3.1.1 Trends:\n\nAbsences and Academic Performance:\nThe detrimental impact of absences becomes progressively more severe with an increasing number of failures. Early academic struggles amplify the negative effects of poor attendance.\nIntervention Priorities:\nWhile reducing absences is beneficial across all categories, targeted interventions are essential for students with multiple failures, as they are disproportionately affected.\nEquity Across Genders:\nGender does not significantly influence the relationship between absences and grades, reinforcing the need for universal strategies that address attendance and performance for all students.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 2. Health Status and Grade Distribution\nThis plot visualizes the distribution of final grades (G3) across different levels of health status (Very Poor to Very Good), with density curves representing gender (F for females in blue and M for males in red). The faceted layout allows for a comparison of grade distributions across health levels and between genders within each health category.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = G3)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_density(aes(color = sex), size = 1) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"F\" = \"royalblue\", \"M\" = \"red\"), name = \"Gender\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ health, labeller = labeller(health = c(\n    \"1\" = \"Very Poor\",\n    \"2\" = \"Poor\",\n    \"3\" = \"Average\",\n    \"4\" = \"Good\",\n    \"5\" = \"Very Good\"\n  ))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Final Grades (G3) by Health Status\",\n    x = \"Final Grades (G3)\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Health Status\",\n    color = \"Gender\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with “Very Good” or “Good” health show the strongest concentration of grades in the upper ranges (15–20), with females consistently achieving slightly higher densities in the top grades compared to males. In contrast, students with “Very Poor” or “Poor” health have flatter distributions, with grades concentrated in the lower ranges (0–10) and a lack of high-performing students. Those with “Average” health status exhibit a more balanced distribution, with grades clustered around 10–15 for both genders.\nOverall, health status strongly correlates with academic performance. Better health is associated with improved grades and consistency, while poorer health increases variability and limits achievement, particularly for students already facing academic challenges.\n\n\n3.3.3 Part 3 Implications\nThis section highlights two key individual factors affecting academic outcomes: absences and health status.\n\nAbsences: The compounding effect of absences and past failures underscores the importance of addressing absenteeism early, particularly for students with academic difficulties. Interventions should focus on reducing absences and providing targeted support to improve grades for at-risk students.\nHealth Status: The positive correlation between health and academic performance emphasizes the need for promoting better health habits and providing health-related resources in schools. This could include health awareness programs, mental health support, and wellness initiatives to ensure students maintain the physical and emotional well-being necessary for academic success.",

    "text": "3.4 Part4. Background Variables and Categorical Analysis\nUnderstanding the broader context of students’ academic performance requires analyzing their background and categorical variables. This section delves into how various types of support systems (family support, school support, and aspirations for higher education) affect G3 grade classification and explores the interdependencies among key categorical variables. Together, these analyses provide insights into the influence of background factors on academic outcomes.\n\n3.4.1 1. Impact of Support Types on G3 Classification\nThis mosaic pairs plot provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships among categorical variables such as gender, support systems, extracurricular activities, and educational aspirations. By visualizing pairwise associations, the plot highlights patterns and potential dependencies between these factors, offering insights into how various support and demographic elements interact within the student population.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(vcd)\n\n\nLoading required package: grid\n\n\nCode\n# Subset your categorical columns\ncategorical_data &lt;- data[, c(2, 16:23)]\n\n# Ensure all categorical columns are factors\ncategorical_data[] &lt;- lapply(categorical_data, as.factor)\n\n# Create a contingency table\ndata_table &lt;- table(categorical_data)\n\npar(cex = 0.1, mar = c(5, 5, 5, 5))  # Adjust text scaling and margins\n#par(cex = 0.8, mar = c(6, 6, 4, 2) + 0.1)  \n# Create a mosaic pairs plot\npairs(data_table, highlighting = 2, \n      main = \"Mosaic Pairs Plot: Categorical Variables Relationships\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender Distribution and Support Systems:\n\nFemale students outnumber male students, as evident from the gender distribution.\nSchool and family support (schoolsup and famsup) exhibit slight imbalances, with “no” responses being more common for family support, while school support has a greater proportion of “yes” responses.\n\nHigher Education Aspirations:\nA large proportion of students aspire to pursue higher education (higher = yes). This group shows strong overlap with students who have received school and family support, suggesting a possible link between support systems and long-term educational goals.\nExtracurricular Activities:\nParticipation in extracurricular activities (activities = yes) is positively associated with both higher education aspirations and family support. Students involved in activities often have a broader support network, reinforcing the importance of engagement beyond academics.\nNursery Attendance and Aspirations:\nStudents who attended nursery school (nursery = yes) are more likely to aspire to higher education, indicating a potential long-term benefit of early educational exposure.\nOther Variables and Patterns:\nInternet access (internet = yes) and being in a romantic relationship (romantic = yes) are relatively evenly distributed across categories, showing no strong associations with support systems or higher education aspirations.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Interpretation:\nThis plot underscores the interplay of support systems, aspirations, and other categorical factors in shaping students’ educational experiences. The strong connection between higher education aspirations and support—both familial and institutional—highlights the importance of fostering a supportive environment. Additionally, early education (e.g., nursery attendance) and extracurricular activities appear to have long-term positive influences on students’ goals and engagement. These insights can inform strategies to better support students in achieving their academic and personal objectives.\n\n\n3.4.3 2. Mosaic Pairs Plot\nThis mosaic pairs plot illustrates the relationships between categorical variables, including gender (sex), family support (famsup), school support (schoolsup), aspirations for higher education (higher), and others.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(vcd)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\n# 分类 G3 成绩组\ndata$G3_group &lt;- case_when(\n  data$G3 &gt;= 15 ~ \"High\",\n  data$G3 &gt;= 10 ~ \"Medium\",\n  TRUE ~ \"Low\"\n)\ndata$G3_group &lt;- as.factor(data$G3_group)\n\n# 修改变量名称为更直观的标签\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    higher = recode(higher, \"yes\" = \"Aspires Higher Education\", \"no\" = \"No Aspiration\"),\n    famsup = recode(famsup, \"yes\" = \"Family Support\", \"no\" = \"No Family Support\"),\n    schoolsup = recode(schoolsup, \"yes\" = \"School Support\", \"no\" = \"No School Support\")\n  )\n\n# 调色板\npalette &lt;- brewer.pal(n = length(levels(data$G3_group)), name = \"Set3\")\n\n# Mosaic Plot\nvcd::mosaic(G3_group ~ famsup + higher + schoolsup, \n            data, \n            direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n            highlighting_fill = palette,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot of G3 Grade Group by Family Support and Higher Education\"\n            )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with aspirations for higher education consistently achieve better academic outcomes. A significant proportion of these students fall into the “High” and “Medium” G3 grade categories, while the “Low” category is markedly reduced compared to students without such aspirations. This underscores the motivational role of higher education goals in driving academic success.\nThe presence of family and school support also plays a critical role. School support is particularly effective in reducing the proportion of “Low” grades while boosting “Medium” and “High” outcomes, especially for students with aspirations for higher education. Family support, while slightly less impactful than school support in this context, still contributes positively to better grades.\nWhen support systems are combined, the best outcomes are observed. Students with both family and school support, coupled with aspirations for higher education, show the highest proportion of “High” grades. Conversely, students without any support systems or aspirations are more likely to be concentrated in the “Low” grade category, highlighting the compounding disadvantage of lacking these key factors.\nThis visualization underscores the importance of aspirations and support systems—both familial and institutional—in shaping academic performance. It highlights the need for targeted interventions to ensure students without support or aspirations are not left behind.\n\n\n3.4.4 Part 4 Implications\nThis analysis highlights the significant role of background factors in shaping student performance. Aspirations for higher education strongly correlate with better academic outcomes, reducing “Low” grades and increasing “High” grades. Both family and school support systems contribute uniquely: family support helps improve “Medium” grades, while school support plays a critical role in mitigating “Low” grades.\nThe relationships among categorical variables, such as gender, extracurricular activities, and early education, emphasize the value of holistic support. Students with nursery school experience or active in extracurriculars are more likely to aspire to higher education, reinforcing the importance of early and sustained engagement.\nIn conclusion, fostering aspirations, strengthening family and school support, and encouraging early and extracurricular involvement can collectively create a foundation for academic success and equitable opportunities.",

    "text": "3.5 Part5: Multivariate Analysis and Comprehensive Patterns\nThis section presents a comprehensive exploration of multivariate relationships and patterns within the dataset. The Parallel Coordinate Plot visualizes normalized values of various academic, behavioral, and contextual variables categorized by school choice reasons. The PCA Biplot illustrates the contributions of different variables in separating the final grade (G3) groups into Low, Medium, and High categories.\n\n\n3.5.1 1. Academic and Behavioral Variables by School Choice Reason\nThis Parallel Coordinate Plot provides a detailed view of academic and behavioral variables for students grouped by their school choice reasons: course, home, other, and reputation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':\n  method from   \n  +.gg   ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Summarize the data\nsummarized_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n    group_by(reason) %&gt;%\n    summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean))\n\n# Plot the parallel coordinate plot\nggparcoord(\n    data = summarized_data,\n    columns = 2:ncol(summarized_data),  \n    groupColumn = 1,                   \n    scale = \"globalminmax\",\n    alphaLines = 0.5\n) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n        plot.margin = margin(10, 20, 10, 20)               \n    ) +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Academic and Behavioral Variables by School Choice Reason\",\n        x = \"Variables\",\n        y = \"Normalized Values\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis parallel coordinate plot highlights group-level differences based on the reason for school choice. The reputation group consistently performs better academically (higher grades in G1, G2, G3) and has higher parental education levels (Medu, Fedu), suggesting a stronger academic focus and support system. In contrast, the other group tends to underperform in grades, indicating potential challenges or differing motivations. Behavioral variables like Dalc (weekday alcohol consumption) and Walc (weekend alcohol consumption) show little variation across groups, while the home group demonstrates slightly better health and lower absences, possibly due to proximity benefits. These patterns suggest a need for tailored support for underperforming groups like other.\n\n3.5.1.1 Commentary\nThe reputation group shows the highest academic performance (G1, G2, G3) and parental education levels (Medu, Fedu). These students also exhibit lower levels of absences and healthier behaviors (e.g., lower alcohol consumption). This group demonstrates a consistent pattern of high achievement and supportive family environments.\nThe home group exhibits moderate grades and relatively good health, aligning with low travel time and absenteeism. This suggests that proximity to school might positively influence both attendance and academic performance.\nStudents in the other group show the lowest grades and higher variability across most variables, such as absenteeism and alcohol consumption. This group’s behavior and performance patterns indicate potential external challenges or lack of motivation.\nFinally, the course group displays moderate performance, with notable variation in study time and health metrics, suggesting a balanced but less focused academic profile compared to the reputation group.\n\n\n3.5.1.2 Insights\n\nHigh grades are strongly associated with the reputation group, likely due to parental education and structured family environments.\nAttendance (absences and travel time) significantly affects grades, with lower absenteeism linked to better performance.\nBehavioral variables (e.g., alcohol consumption) show a negative correlation with academic achievement across all groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 2. PCA Biplot - Variables and G3 Grade Groups\nThis PCA Biplot maps students into Low, Medium, and High G3 grade groups while illustrating the influence of academic, behavioral, and contextual variables on grade differentiation.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Prepare data by removing G1, G2, and G3 and ensure only numeric variables are used\npca_data &lt;- data[, !(names(data) %in% c(\"G1\", \"G2\", \"G3\"))]\npca_data &lt;- pca_data[sapply(pca_data, is.numeric)]  # Keep only numeric columns\n\n# Perform PCA\npca_result &lt;- prcomp(pca_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)\n\n# Add G3 group labels (Low, Medium, High)\ndata$G3_group &lt;- factor(ifelse(data$G3 &gt;= 15, \"High\",\n                               ifelse(data$G3 &gt;= 10, \"Medium\", \"Low\")))\n\n# Prepare PCA results for plotting\npca_plot_data &lt;- data.frame(pca_result$x, G3_group = data$G3_group)\n\n# Aggregate to get one point for each group\naggregated_data &lt;- pca_plot_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(G3_group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(PC1 = mean(PC1), PC2 = mean(PC2))\n\n# Create the biplot\nggplot(aggregated_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = G3_group)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = G3_group), vjust = -1, size = 4) +\n  geom_segment(data = as.data.frame(pca_result$rotation), \n               aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = PC1 * 2, yend = PC2 * 2),\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, \"cm\")), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data = as.data.frame(pca_result$rotation), \n            aes(x = PC1 * 2.2, y = PC2 * 2.2, label = rownames(pca_result$rotation)),\n            color = \"blue\", size = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Biplot with G3 Grade Groups (Low, Medium, High)\",\n       x = \"PC 1 (Principal Component 1)\", \n       y = \"PC 2 (Principal Component 2)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis PCA biplot effectively illustrates the relationships between variables and their influence on distinguishing G3 grade groups (Low, Medium, High). Key variables like studytime, Medu, and Fedu align with higher grades, while failures and age are associated with lower grades. The directions and proximities of arrows reveal correlations among variables, such as Walc and Dalc. The separation of G3 groups along PC1 highlights how these variables differentiate grade performance, making the plot a valuable tool for understanding underlying patterns.\n\n3.5.2.1 Commentary\nThe first principal component (PC1) separates students primarily based on academic variables like study time, Medu, and Fedu. The High G3 group aligns closely with these variables, indicating their strong positive impact on academic performance.\nThe second principal component (PC2) highlights behavioral variables such as alcohol consumption (Dalc, Walc) and failures, which are negatively correlated with grades. The Low G3 group clusters near these variables, reflecting their detrimental effects on academic success.\nKey variables like health, famrel, and absences contribute to grade variability but are more neutral, aligning with the Medium G3 group. These variables highlight the balancing factors influencing moderate performance levels.\n\n\n3.5.2.2 Insights\n\nParental education (Medu, Fedu) and study time are the strongest predictors of high grades.\nNegative behavioral patterns, such as failures and alcohol consumption, are key indicators of low performance.\nHealth and family relationships act as stabilizing factors for medium-grade students.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Implications and Conclusion\nThe multivariate analysis underscores the importance of both contextual and behavioral variables in determining academic success. High-performing students benefit from supportive family environments, structured study routines, and positive health behaviors. In contrast, low-performing students are often associated with negative behaviors like alcohol consumption and higher failure rates.\nThese findings suggest targeted interventions focusing on improving behavioral habits and addressing absenteeism could significantly benefit medium- and low-performing students. Additionally, leveraging parental involvement and structured family support systems could further enhance overall academic outcomes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(vcd)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\ndata$G3_group &lt;- case_when(\n  data$G3 &gt;= 15 ~ \"High\",\n  data$G3 &gt;= 10 ~ \"Medium\",\n  TRUE ~ \"Low\"\n)\ndata$G3_group &lt;- as.factor(data$G3_group)\n\npalette &lt;- brewer.pal(n = length(levels(data$G3_group)), name = \"Set3\")\n\nvcd::mosaic(G3_group ~ famsup + higher + schoolsup, \n            data, \n            direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),\n            highlighting_fill = palette,\n            main = \"Mosaic Plot of G3 Grade Group by Family Support and Higher Education\"\n            )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# 加载所需的包\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# 绘制散点图\nggplot(data, aes(x = absences, y = G3, color = studytime)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3) +  # 添加散点\n  facet_wrap(~ famrel, labeller = labeller(famrel = c(\n    \"1\" = \"Very Poor\",\n    \"2\" = \"Poor\",\n    \"3\" = \"Average\",\n    \"4\" = \"Good\",\n    \"5\" = \"Very Good\"\n  ))) +  # 按家庭关系分面并设置标签\n  #scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +  # 学习时间的颜色渐变\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Absences vs Final Grades by Family Relationship\",\n    x = \"Absences\",\n    y = \"Final Grades (G3)\",\n    color = \"Study Time (hours)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = studytime, y = G3, color = higher)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"yes\" = \"darkgreen\", \"no\" = \"purple\"), name = \"Higher Education\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Study Time vs Final Grades by Higher Education Aspiration\",\n    x = \"Study Time (hours/day)\",\n    y = \"Final Grades (G3)\",\n    color = \"Aspiration\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: No shared levels found between `names(values)` of the manual scale and the\ndata's colour values.\nNo shared levels found between `names(values)` of the manual scale and the\ndata's colour values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = activities, fill = romantic)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", aes(fill = romantic)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ higher) +  # 按 higher 分面\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"yes\" = \"pink\", \"no\" = \"blue\"), name = \"Romantic Relationship\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Extracurricular Activities and Romantic Relationship by Higher Education Aspiration\",\n    x = \"Participation in Activities\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Romantic\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggmosaic)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'ggmosaic'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:GGally':\n\n    happy\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:vcd':\n\n    mosaic, spine\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(weight = 1, x = product(higher, romantic), fill = activities)) +\n  #scale_fill_manual(name = \"Activities\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Higher Education Aspiration with Activities and Romantic Relationship\",\n    x = \"Higher Education Aspiration and Romantic Relationship\",\n    y = \"Proportion\",\n    fill = \"Participation in Activities\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: The `scale_name` argument of `continuous_scale()` is deprecated as of ggplot2\n3.5.0.\n\n\nWarning: The `trans` argument of `continuous_scale()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.5.0.\nℹ Please use the `transform` argument instead.\n\n\nWarning: `unite_()` was deprecated in tidyr 1.2.0.\nℹ Please use `unite()` instead.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggmosaic package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/haleyjeppson/ggmosaic&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = G3)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_density(color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ health, labeller = labeller(health = c(\n    \"1\" = \"Very Poor\",\n    \"2\" = \"Poor\",\n    \"3\" = \"Average\",\n    \"4\" = \"Good\",\n    \"5\" = \"Very Good\"\n  ))) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Final Grades (G3) by Health Status\",\n    x = \"Final Grades (G3)\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Health Status\"\n  )",

    "text": "4.2 Key Insights from the Visualizatio\nThis visualization reveals several noteworthy patterns. As the quality of family relationships improves, there is a clear shift in the distribution of final grades toward higher values. For example, students with “Very Good” family relationships exhibit higher final grades compared to those with “Very Poor” relationships. The peak of the distribution for “Very Poor” relationships is concentrated around lower grades, whereas the peak for “Very Good” relationships is centered on higher grades. This suggests a positive association between strong family relationships and better academic performance. Additionally, the varying shapes and spreads of the distributions reflect the level of grade variability within each family relationship category. Broader distributions indicate greater diversity in academic outcomes. These findings emphasize the potential role of familial support in influencing students’ academic success, underscoring the importance of a supportive home environment in shaping educational outcomes.",
