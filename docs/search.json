    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis dataset, titled Student Performance, provides a comprehensive view of student achievement across two core subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese. It includes a diverse range of features, such as demographic, social, and school-related variables, with grades from different assessment periods. By analyzing this dataset, We aim to uncover patterns and relationships that contribute to academic success, which could inform data-driven interventions in education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators and policymakers to identify areas for support, which will ultimately enhancing student achievement. Key questions include: How do parental education levels affect student outcomes? What impact do extracurricular activities and study habits have on performance? Additionally, the dataset allows for predictive modeling, offering valuable insights into final grade predictions based on prior performance and other influencing factors. This analysais not only deepens our understanding of real-world applications of data science in education but also highlights the potential of data-driven strategies to improve learning outcomes.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we use the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset was collected by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva from the University of Minho. It contains data on secondary school students from two Portuguese schools, providing attributes such as demographic, social, and academic performance information. The dataset includes two separate files for performance in Mathematics (student-mat.csv) and Portuguese language (student-por.csv). This time, we just use student-por.csv for the project.\nThe data is stored in CSV format, making it easy to process with tool R. It includes 30 attributes for each student, such as gender, age, family background, and academic grades. The datasets have dimensions of 649 rows for Portuguese language. The data is static and does not undergo updates, as it was collected for a specific research study in 2008.\nPotential issues with the data include: Imbalanced attributes, such as few students in certain categories (e.g., higher education aspirations). Missing values, although these are not explicitly documented, will require investigation. Correlation among features, such as multiple related attributes about family and study time.\nWe imported the data using the RStudio by downloading the CSV files directly from the UCI Machine Learning repository.\nLink for the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance",
